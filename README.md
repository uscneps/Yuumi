# **Yuumi - League of Legends Discord Bot for Item Builder**

### **How It Works**
1. A user sends a command like `/build gnar` or `!build gnar` in a Discord server.
2. Yumii queries the **Mistral AI agent** (temperature: `0.01`, model: `NeMo`) with the provided champion name.
3. The API returns an optimal item build formatted as:   `BUILD -> Doran's Ring > Hextech Gunblade > Nashor's Tooth > Rabadon's Deathcap > Void Staff > Zhonya's Hourglass`

### Tech Stack
- **Rust** ü¶Ä
- **Poise** (Discord framework)
- **Tokio** (Async runtime)
- **Reqwest** (HTTP requests)
- **Serde** (JSON parsing)
- **Mistral AI** (LLM API for processing builds)
  - API URL: https://api.mistral.ai/v1/agents/completions
  - Model : NeMo
  - Max Tokens: 150
